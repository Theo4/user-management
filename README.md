User Management
===========

This is a simple PHP class which allows you to have main user functions integrated in your project. A few example pages for login, logout, registration, update and preview are included in the repository. Also a page with simple example of the groups and permissions functionality is available. In the project is also a very handy DB class for database operations. Additional examples can be made from the Unit tests for both classes. A demo databse can be found in tests/_data/.
